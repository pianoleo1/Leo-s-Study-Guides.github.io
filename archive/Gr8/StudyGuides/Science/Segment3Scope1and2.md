# Segment 3, Scope 1 and 2 Study Guide

## Scope 1 - Newton's Third Law of Motion

1. When you hit something, that thing receives the same amount of pain as you do.

2. **System**: A group of related parts that make up a whole, and every part is needed.

3. Forces are applied to systems to make things happen.

4. Force is measured in **newtons**. 1 lb = 4.45 N.

5. Weight and mass have **directly proportional** relationship. 

6. 
\  | Mass | Weight | Friction
--- | --- | --- | ---
Definition | The amount of matter an object conains | Force of gravity acting on an object (acting on 100g = one newton) | The amount of resistance when two objects rub past each other.
Fact | Mass doesn't change when an object's location changes. | Weight changes by location.
Example | An apple's atoms | An apple weighed on a spring scale | Hockey pock rushes past ice

7. **NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION**: For every action, there is an **equal and opposite** reaction. The action and reaction force are acting on different objects in pairs. Force is measured by a spring scale in newtons. During action, there is direct contact; during reaction, there's contact at a distance.

8. Action-reaction force graphs **always** have an equation of x = y. They are always proportional.

9. Newton - Acceleration of one meter per second per second.

10. There are always force pairs that act upon each other.

11. **Motion**: The change in an object's position with respect to time and in comparison to the position of other objects used as reference points.

12. **Force**: A push or pull that changes the motion of an object.

13. **Newton's First Law**: A body at rest remains at rest. A body in motion stays in motion.

14. **Newton's Second Law**: Force = Mass x Acceleration; F=MA Acceleration is dirrectly proportional to force and inversely proportional to mass.

15. **Newton's Third Law**: For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.

16. Mass decides which objects move more or less.

17. Action reaction is net cause and effect because everything happens at the same time.

18. Unbalanced forces are caused by net force inbalance.

19. If all forces acting on an object has a net force of 0, the force is balanced.

20. Rockets expel gas backwards with high speed, propelling it forward.

21. Rockets expel gas backward, not on the ground.

## Friction Notes

22. Definition | 23. Cause | 24. Factors to depend on | 25. Types | 26. Ways of using | 27. Ways of reducing
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
A force that is exerted when two substances are rubbed together. | Microscopic hills and valleys slide past each other in objects, and the hills and valleys cause them to not slide as easily as one without microscopic hills and valleys. | Types of surfaces involved (rough surfaces produce greater friction). | **Rolling friction**: When an object rolls over a surface.| **Walking** (shoes are under friction to the floor) | Ball bearings
A Force that resists the motion of objects or surfaces. | | How hard surfaces push together. | **Sliding Friction**: When solids slide over another. | **Automobile** (friction between tires and road) | Oiling parts of machines
|||| **Fluid Friction**: When an object moves through liquid and gas. | **Lighting a match**

## Scope 2 - Changes in Force and Motion

28. When an object's distance is changing from another object, called the **reference point** or **origin**, it is in motion.

29. It takes more force to put a heavier object in motion than it does to put a lighter object in motion.

30. **Inertia**: The tendency of an object to remain at rest or remain in motion; The capacity of an object to resist changes in motion.

31. Inertia depends on the **mass** of the object. More mass = more inertia.

32. If forces are moving an object all in the same direction, we add up the smaller forces to find out the total amount of force acting on the object.

33. **Balanced force** = Object moving at constant velocity; **Unbalanced force** = Object accelerating.

34. **Speed** is a *scalar* (only referring to a number) quantity, the rate at which an object moves a certain distance. s = distance/t

35. **Velocity** is a *vector* (involving both the number and direction) quantity. It is the speed at which an object is displaced. v = displacement/t

36. **Acceleration** = Change in Velocity/Time
