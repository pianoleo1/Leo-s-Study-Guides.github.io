## Nature of Matter
### Ions
Ions are atoms that have positive or negative charge by reducing or increasing the number of electrons.

**Cat-ions**: An ion that has a net positive charge. (Ex. $Ca^{2+}$)

**An-ions**: An ion that has a net negative charge.

### Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms with changed number of neutrons. They are used to find the age of fossils, treat cancer, and used as tracers to help locate substance movement in living organisms.

**Radioactive isotopes**: Isotopes with unstable nuclei that break down.
### Compounds

Substances that have greater than or equal to two elements combined in a **fixed ratio**.

### Chemical Bonds

**Ionic Bonds**: attractions between oppositely charged ions.

**Covalent bonds**: when atoms share electrons.

**Polar**: Unequal charge resulting on the atoms.

**Nonpolar**: Equal charge resulting on the atoms.

**Intermolecular attractions**: Occurs between molecules, but they are very weak. (Ex. **Hydrogen Bonds**)
