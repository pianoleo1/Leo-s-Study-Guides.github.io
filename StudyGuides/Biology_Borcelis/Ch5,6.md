Word | Definition
--- | ---
geographic range | the location(s) of the population
population density | number of individuals per unit area
population distribution | The way that individuals are spread out (uniform, clumped, random)
age structure | The age and sex of the population
immigration | moving in from elsewhere
emigration | moving out
exponential growth | rapid growth due to offspring (j-curve)
logistic growth | when a population growth slows and stops (s-curve)
carrying capacity | number of individuals that an environment can support
limiting factor | a factor that controls the population
demography | scientific study of human populations
demographic transition | change from high birth rates and death rates to lower birth and death rates
habitat | the specific place that an organism lives
tolerance | variety of environmental conditions in which it can survive and reproduce
niche | where an organism lives and what it does (it's interactions with the environment)
resource | a necessity of life
competitive exclusion principle | the principle stating that no two species can occupy the same niche simultaneously
keystone species | a species that provides structure and stability in an ecosystem
symbiosis | interdependent relationship between two species
commensalism | a type of symbiosis in which one organism is benefited, but the other is unaffected
mutualism | a type of symbiosis in which both species benefits
parasitism | a type of symbiosis in which one species benefits and the other is harmed
ecological succession | a series of predictable events that occur over time
primary succession | succession from noew land or rock
pioneer species | the first species to colonize barren areas.
secondary succession | when disturbance does not completely destroy the community, and it regrows
biodiversity | varieties of organisms
ecosystem diversity | variety in habitats, communities, and processes
species diversity | number of different species
genetic diversity | variations of genes within one species
resilience | the ability for a natural or human system to recover from a disturbance
ecosystem services | services provided by healthy, diverse ecosystems (such as producing foods, recycling nutrients, etc.)
conservation biology | protecting and preserving natural resources

## 5.1

Ecologists study populations by examining their geographic range, growth rate, density and distribution, and age structure.

### Factors that affect population growth

1. Birth and death rate

2. immigration and emigration rate

### Growth stages

#### Phase 1

Population grows rapidly

#### Phase 2

Growth slows down

#### Phase 3

Growth stops

### Vocab words

population density, population distribution, age structure, immigration, emigration, exponential growth, logistic growth, carrying capacity.

## 5.2

### **Limiting factors** include (but not limited to)

density-dependent: diseases, competition, predator-prey, herbivory, resources, stress from overcrowding.

density-independent: Natural disastors, extreme weather.

### Vocab words

limiting factor, density-dependent limiting factor, density-independent limiting factor

## 5.3

The human population grew slowly at first, but as technologies developed, human population grew exponentially.

### Vocab words

demography, demographic transition

## 6.1

If environmental conditions falls above or below tolerance, organisms need more energy for maintaining homeostasis, and they have less energy for growth and reproductions.

### Organism interactions

Predator-prey

Herbivore-plant

### Vocab words

habitat, tolerance, niche, resource, competitive exclusion principle, keystone species, symbiosis, commensalism, mutualism, parasitism
