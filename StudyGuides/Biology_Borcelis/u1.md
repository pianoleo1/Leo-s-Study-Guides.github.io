# Unit 1 - The Nature of Life (Study Guide)

## Vocabulary

**observation**: Process of noticing and describing events or processes in a careful, orderly way.

**inference**: A logical interpretation based on prior knowledge and experience.

**hypotheses**: Possible explanation for a set of observations, or possible answers to a scientific question.

**qualitative data**: Data consisting of observations (size, color etc.).

**quantitative data**: Data consisting of numbers. (Has to be *precise and accurate*)

**precise**: Similar to other trials.

**accurate**: NOmerical accuracy (by reading measurements, etc.).

**scientists** explain things in our world.

**science** . . . 

- Uses evidence

- Generates knowledge

- Is a process

- Predicts natural events

- Uses data

**scientific Methodology**: Observing and asking questions, and it focuses on one factor at a time.

**control group**: The group that stays normal.

**experimental group**: The group that receives the change that is nessecerry to test.

**scientific theory**: Explains why

**scientific law**: Describes behavior based on a series of experiments.

## Nature of Matter
### Ions
Ions are atoms that have positive or negative charge by reducing or increasing the number of electrons.

**Cat-ions**: An ion that has a net positive charge. (Ex. $Ca^{2+}$)

**An-ions**: An ion that has a net negative charge.

### Isotopes

Isotopes are atoms with changed number of neutrons. They are used to find the age of fossils, treat cancer, and used as tracers to help locate substance movement in living organisms.

**Radioactive isotopes**: Isotopes with unstable nuclei that break down.
### Chemical Compounds

Substances that have $\ge$ to two elements combined in a **fixed ratio**.

### Chemical Bonds

**Ionic Bonds**: attractions between oppositely charged ions.

**Covalent bonds**: when atoms share electrons.

**Polar**: Unequal charge resulting on the atoms.

**Nonpolar**: Equal charge resulting on the atoms.

**Intermolecular attractions**: Occurs between molecules, but they are very weak. Ex. Van der waals forces, **Hydrogen Bonds** (Bonding by $\pm$ attracting to each other).

## Water

**Water . . .**

- is **polar**,

- is a universal **solvent**,

- has high **heat** **capacity** (or high specific heat), and

- has **cohesive** (attraction between two of the same molecule) and **adhesive** (attraction between two chemically different molecules) capabilities.

Water uses hydrogen bonding to covalent bond.

V | Def
--- | ---
capillary action | When water goes up thin tubes, leveraging adhesion and cohesion.
mixture |  When two substances are not chemically bonded, and they can still be physically seperated.
solution | When a solvent dissolves a solute.
suspension | Not dissolved, but still seperated by solvent (Ex. sand in water).
buffers | Weak acids or bases that prevent sharp changes in pH.

---
Higher pH = more basic (OH-); lower pH = more acidic (H+)
