# Fall Final Study Guide

## Chapter 1: Investigating Biology

### 1. Characteristics of living things
- maintain homeostasis
- have at least 1 cell
- grow and develop
- reproduce
- respond to stimuli
- evolve
- based on a universal genetic code (DNA)
- metabolize

### 2. The relationship between biodiversity and species

Biodiversity is the variety of organisms, and species is just one type of organism that can mate and produce fertile offspring.

### 3. The importance of homeostasis

Homeostasis is the state of relatively constant internal physical and chemical conditions.

Ex. A body sweating in weather above 37&deg;C

Homeostasis is important because it helps organisms adapt to changes in environment.

### 4. Quantitative and qualitative data

**quantitative data**: Data that can be measured by numbers (Ex. The pool is exactly 5 feet deep.)

**qualitative data**: Data that are not numbers (Ex. This apple is red)

### 5. Graphing

Use the acronym "**TAILS**"

**t**itle

**a**xis

**i**nterval

**l**abels

**s**cale

independent variable $x$: The variable that is changed during an experiment/does not depend on another factor.

dependent variable $y$: The variable that depends on $x$.

### 6. Parts & function of a microscope + magnification

#### Parts & function

Parts | Function
--- | ---
Eyepiece lens | Viewing
Revolving nosepiece | Holds objectives and allows switching
Low power objectives | Low magnification (**40x total**)
Medium power objectives | Medium magnification (**100x total**)
High power objective | High magnification (**400 total**)
Stage clips | Secures slide in place
Diaphram | Controls light intensity
Light | Provides illumination
Arm | Provies structural stability
Stage | Holds slide for viewing
Coarse adjustment knob | Large focus change
Find adjustment knob | Small focus change
Cord | Power
Base | Stability
Slide | Holding specimen
Cover Slip | Protects/secures specimen

#### Magnification

[Magnification of eyepiece (10x)] $\cdot$ [Magnification of nosepiece] = [Total magnification]

### 7. Fact, theory, and hypothesis

[Credible source for further reading](https://ncse.ngo/definitions-fact-theory-and-law-scientific-work)

**fact**: an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and that is accepted as "true".

**scientific theory**: a well-supported concept that has broad explanatory power.

**hypothesis**: Possible explanation for a set of observations, or possible answers to a scientific question.


### 8. 8 levels of organization (smallest to largest)

[unfinished: check back soon!]

### 9. CER

claim: a statement<br>
evidence: data to support the claim<br>
reasoning: links the evidence to the claim.

## Chapter 2: Chemistry of living things

### 1. Water 
 <mark>__________</mark> 

#### Structure
H<sub>2</sub>O

#### Bonds

#### Properties

Water is **polar** (uneven charge between the atoms).

Water is an excellent **solvent**.

Water has **cohesion** (attraction between same molecules) and **adhesion** (attraction between two chemically different molecules) properties.

Water has a **high specific heat** (amount of energy needed to heat one gram of water by 1 &deg;C)

Water uses hydrogen bonding to covalent bond (when atoms share electrons): The negatively charged oxygen atom hydrogen bonds to the positive hydrogen atoms.

### 2. Solutions and pH

#### Solutions

**solute**: the matter being dissolved. <br>
**solvent**: the matter that dissolves. <br>
**solution**: the result of the process of dissolving.

#### pH

higher pH = more basic (OH<sup>-</sup>)
<br> lower pH = more acidic (H<sup>+</sup>)

word | definition
--- | ---
capillary action | When water goes up thin tubes, leveraging adhesion and cohesion.
mixture |  When two substances are not chemically bonded, and they can still be physically seperated.
solution | When a solvent dissolves a solute.
suspension | Not dissolved, but still seperated by solvent (Ex. sand in water).
buffers | Weak acids or bases that prevent sharp changes in pH.

### 3. Macromolecules

Polymer | Monomer | Function | General Structure | Molecular Structure | Examples
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Carbohydrate (Polysacchoride) | Monosacchoride (glucose, other *ose*) | Energy, structure protection | CHO | ![carbohydrate molecular structure](https://chemistrytalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/beta-glucose-haworth-1.png) | Starch, rice, pasta
Lipid (Triglycerides) | Glycerol & fatty acids | Energy storage, membranes, chemical messengers, Insulation, cushioning, waterproof covers. | CH (long hydrocarbon chains)O | ![lipids molecular structure](https://chemistrytalk.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/221_Fatty_Acids_Shapes-01.jpg) | Oils, fish, avocado
Proteins (polypeptides) | Amino Acids | Act as enzymes, communication between cells, cellular structures, transport substances, fight disease (Vitamin C). | CHON | ![Protein structure](https://www.creative-proteomics.com/pronalyse/upload/image/what-are-protein-structure-1.jpg) | Meats, beans
Nucleic Acids (Polynucleotides [DNA, RNA]) | Nucleotide (pentose (5-carbon sugar), phosphate group, nitrogenous base) | Stores and transmits genetics | CHONP | ![Nucleic Acids molecular structure](https://study.com/cimages/multimages/16/Nucleotide_simple.png) | Strawberry, beef

### 4. The role of enzymes in chemical reactions

Enzymes bind to substrates, breaking or combining them. This speeds up chemical reactions by reducing the activation energy.

### 5. Enzymatic reactions

<mark>Pencil</mark>

### 6. The Lock and Key Model of enzymes

An enzyme's active site (the lock) can only bind to a specific substrate(the key). The substrate is like a key that starts the chemical reaction.

### 7. The effects of various environments on enzymes

**Temperature**: increaseing temperature increases the rate of the reaction (particles move faster).
<br>**pH**: changes can affect the speed of a reaction.
<br>**competitive inhibitors**: other foreign substrates compete with substrates that actually binds to the active site.

### 8. When an enzyme is denatured

The active site is deformed and cannot accept substrates caused by **(extreme pH changes, temperature, ion strength, and solubility)**.
