# Fall Final Study Guide

## Chapter 1: Investigating Biology

### 1. Characteristics of living things
- maintain homeostasis
- have at least 1 cell
- grow and develop
- reproduce
- respond to stimuli
- evolve
- based on a universal genetic code (DNA)
- metabolize

### 2. The relationship between biodiversity and species

Biodiversity is the variety of organisms, and species is just one type of organism that can mate and produce fertile offspring.

### 3. The importance of homeostasis

Homeostasis is the state of relatively constant internal physical and chemical conditions.

Ex. A body sweating in weather above 37&deg;C

Homeostasis is important because it helps organisms adapt to changes in environment.

### 4. Quantitative and qualitative data
