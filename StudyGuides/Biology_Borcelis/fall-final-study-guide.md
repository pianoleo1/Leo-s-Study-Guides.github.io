# Fall Final Study Guide

## Chapter 1: Investigating Biology

### 1. Characteristics of living things
- maintain homeostasis
- have at least 1 cell
- grow and develop
- reproduce
- respond to stimuli
- evolve
- based on a universal genetic code (DNA)
- metabolize

### 2. The relationship between biodiversity and species

Biodiversity is the variety of organisms, and species is just one type of organism that can mate and produce fertile offspring.

### 3. The importance of homeostasis

Homeostasis is the state of relatively constant internal physical and chemical conditions.

Ex. A body sweating in weather above 37&deg;C

Homeostasis is important because it helps organisms adapt to changes in environment.

### 4. Quantitative and qualitative data

**quantitative data**: Data that can be measured by numbers (Ex. The pool is exactly 5 feet deep.)

**qualitative data**: Data that are not numbers (Ex. This apple is red)

### 5. Graphing

Use the acronym "**TAILS**"

**t**itle

**a**xis

**i**nterval

**l**abels

**s**cale

independent variable $x$: The variable that is changed during an experiment/does not depend on another factor.

dependent variable $y$: The variable that depends on $x$.

### Parts & function of a microscope + magnification

#### Parts & function

Parts | Function
--- | ---
Eyepiece lens | Viewing
Revolving nosepiece | Holds objectives and allows switching
Low power objectives | Low magnification (**40x total**)
Medium power objectives | Medium magnification (**100x total**)
High power objective | High magnification (**400 total**)
Stage clips | Secures slide in place
Diaphram | Controls light intensity
Light | Provides illumination
Arm | Provies structural stability
Stage | Holds slide for viewing
Coarse adjustment knob | Large focus change
Find adjustment knob | Small focus change
Cord | Power
Base | Stability
Slide | Holding specimen
Cover Slip | Protects/secures specimen

#### Magnification

[Magnification of eyepiece (10x)] $\cdot$ [Magnification of nosepiece] = [Total magnification]

### Fact, theory, and hypothesis

[Credible source for further reading](https://ncse.ngo/definitions-fact-theory-and-law-scientific-work)

**fact**: an observation that has been repeatedly confirmed and that is accepted as "true".

**scientific theory**: a well-supported concept that has broad explanatory power.

**hypothesis**: Possible explanation for a set of observations, or possible answers to a scientific question.


### 8 levels of organization (smallest to largest)
