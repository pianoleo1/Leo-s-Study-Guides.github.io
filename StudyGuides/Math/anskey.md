# Answer Key: Polygon Quiz

1. **What is the sum of the interior angles of a hexagon?**  
   **Answer:** **b) 720Â°** âœ…  
   *Formula: \( (6-2) \times 180 = 720^\circ \)*  

2. **If a polygon has 9 sides, how many diagonals does it have?**  
   **Answer:** **c) 27** âœ…  
   *Formula: \( \frac{9(9-3)}{2} = 27 \)*  

3. **True or False:** The sum of the exterior angles of a decagon is **1440Â°**.  
   **Answer:** **False** âœ…  
   *The sum of exterior angles for any polygon is always **\( 360^\circ \)**, not **\( 1440^\circ \)**.*  

4. **What is the formula to calculate the sum of the interior angles of an \( n \)-sided polygon?**  
   **Answer:** \( (n-2) \times 180 \) âœ…  

5. **How many diagonals does a pentagon have?**  
   **Answer:** **b) 5** âœ…  
   *Formula: \( \frac{5(5-3)}{2} = 5 \)*  

6. **Fill in the blank: A quadrilateral has _____ diagonals.**  
   **Answer:** **2** âœ…  
   *Formula: \( \frac{4(4-3)}{2} = 2 \)*  

7. **If a polygon has an interior angle sum of 1260Â°, how many sides does it have?**  
   **Answer:** **9** âœ…  
   *Solving:*  
   \[
   (n-2) \times 180 = 1260
   \]  
   \[
   n-2 = 7
   \]  
   \[
   n = 9
   \]  

8. **What is the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon, regardless of the number of sides?**  
   **Answer:** \( 360^\circ \) âœ…  

9. **If a polygon has 10 sides, how many diagonals does it have?**  
   **Answer:** **35** âœ…  
   *Formula: \( \frac{10(10-3)}{2} = 35 \)*  

10. **What is the formula for finding the number of diagonals in an \( n \)-sided polygon?**  
    **Answer:**  
    \[
    \frac{n(n-3)}{2}
    \]  
    âœ…
