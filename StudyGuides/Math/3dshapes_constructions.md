# Study Guide: 3D Shapes, Circles, & Constructions

## 3D Shapes

## Circles

Word | Meaning
--- | ---
circle | A set of coplaner points equidistant from a fixed point called the center.
radius | A line segment that stretches from the center of the circle to the circle.
diameter | A line segment that stretches from one side of the circle to another and passes through the center.
chord | A line segment that passes through two points on a circle.
Sector | A part of a circle

Central angle &ang;AOB = $m$&#8978;AB = $a$

Inscribed angle &ang;AMB = $a/2$

**Theorem**: If a quadrilateral has opposite angles that are supplementary, then the quadrilateral is cyclic (vertices are concyclic, quad. is inscribed in circle).


## Constructions

**You should know all of these constructions**:

1. Construct the perpendicular bisector of a line segment, or construct the midpoint of a line segment.

2. Given a point on a line, construct a perpendicular line through the given point.

3. Given a point not on a line, construct a perpendicular line through the given point.

4. Construct the bisector of an angle.

5. Construct an angle congruent to a given angle.

6. Construct a line through a given point, parallel to a given line.

7. Construct an equilateral triangle, or construct a 60째 angle.

8. Construct a regular hexagon.

9. Construct a square, given a line segment.

10. Construct a 30째-60째-90째 triangle.

11. Construct a kite.

12. Construct the **centroid** of a triangle.
