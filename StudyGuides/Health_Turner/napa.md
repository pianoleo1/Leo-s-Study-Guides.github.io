# Nutrition and Physical Fitness Notes

## Nutrient Notes

**nutrition**: The process of choosing and consuming food necessary for health and growth.

**nutrients**: Chemical substances that provide the nutrition essential for **growth, energy, and function**.

### Carbohydrates

Major source of energy for the body, found in **fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy**.

Types: **sugar (simple), starch(complex), and dietary fiber**.

**Glucose** powers the brain and central nervous system.

**Fructose** come from fruits.

**Sucrose** is table sugar.

**Starch** is found in grains, beans, and some vegetables.

**Dietary fiber** cannot be fully broken down by the body. Found in **plant-based foods**.

Dietary fiber . . . 

- Contains no calories

- Prevents constipation

- Decreases risks of colon cancer

- Reduces cholesteral absorbtion into the bloodstream.

## Protein

Acts as hormones and enzymes.

**Essential** amino acids are nine amino acids that are not produced by the body. (essential for diet)

**Complete** proteins --> animal-based

**Incomplete** proteins --> plant-based

## Fats

**Saturated**: primarily found in **animal based** foods, and they are **solid at room temperature**.

**Unsaturated**: **plant-based** foods, liquid at room temperature.

***Trans fats*** artificially made, more saturated. In 2015, the FDA banned artificial *trans fat*.

# Physical Fitness

Aspects of fitness

1. ***cardiorespiratory endurance**: The ability of the cardiorespiratory (heart, lungs, and blood vessels) system to endure ten minutes or more of a continuous aerobic exercise.

2. **muscular strength**: Amount of force that a muscle can exert.

3. **muscular endurance**; The ability of the muscles to perform physical tasks over a period of time.

4. **flexibility**: The body's ability to move a body part through a full range of motion.

5. **body composition**: The ratio of body fat and lean body tissue (mostly muscles). Muscles are more dense than fat (heavier than fat).

- Resting metabolic rate: Energy required to keep a body functioning at rest.

- Muscle cells burns more calories than fat cells

- **aerobic exercise**: Exercise that can be maintained and help with endurance, and it increases a person's heart and breathing rate.

- **anaerobic exercise**: Short bursts of intense activity.
