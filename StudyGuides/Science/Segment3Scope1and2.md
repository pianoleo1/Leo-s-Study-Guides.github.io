# Segment 3, Scope 1 and 2 Study Guide

## Scope 1 - Newton's Third Law of Motion

1. When you hit something, that thing receives the same amount of pain as you do.

2. **System**: A group of related parts that make up a whole, and every part is needed.

3. Forces are applied to systems to make things happen.

4. Force is measured in **newtons**. 1 lb = 4.45 N.

5. Weight and mass have **directly proportional** relationship. 

\  | Mass | Weight | Friction
--- | --- | --- | ---
Definition | The amount of matter an object conains | Force of gravity acting on an object | The amount of resistance when two objects rub past each other.
Example | An apple's atoms | An apple weighed on a spring scale | Hockey pock rushes past ice

**NEWTON'S THIRD LAW OF MOTION**: For every action, there is an **equal and opposite** reaction. The action and reaction force are acting on different objects. Force is measured by a spring scale in newtons.
