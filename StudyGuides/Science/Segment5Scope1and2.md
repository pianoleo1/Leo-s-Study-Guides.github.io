### Concept Attainment Quiz

1. Thermal energy exchange between objects of different temperatures: **Heat transfer**
2. Thermal energy that is transferred through empty space: **Radiation**
3. Thermal energy that is transferred when two objects of different temperatures touch: **Conduction**
4. The transfer of heat by the movement of currents of liquid or gas: **Convection**
5. The average kinetic energy of all the particles in a material: **Temperature**
6. When ice cubes melt in a glass of water, a current forms in which heat energy moves from particles with a higher temperature to particles with a **lower** temperature.
7. Materials such as metal and wire are good **conductors** because heat can easily transfer through them.
8. **Thermal** energy always moves from objects with **higher** temperatures to objects with **lower** temperatures.
9. Insulators **minimize** thermal energy transfer.
10. Give an example and explain each type of thermal energy transfer (conduction, convection, and radiation):

    Conduction is heat energy transferred by direct contact. A pan sitting on an electric stove top heats up by conduction. The water inside the pan heats up mostly by convection, which is heating by currents moving through a fluid. Radiation is the transfer of heat energy through space. A heat lamp at a restaurant keeps the food warm by radiation.
11. If two objects have different temperatures, in which direction will heat move? For how long?

    Heat energy always flows from the object with the higher temperature to the one with lower temperature. The heat energy will flow until they are at the same temperature.
    
## Segment 5, Scope 2

### Notes

1. How does a thermometer measure your fever?
2. **Thermal energy** is the total energy of all its moving particles.
3. **Temperature** measures the average kinetic energy of an object's particles.
4. Energy is never created or destroyed. It simply changes form.
5. A lukewarm bath can help transfer some of your fever energy as heat.
6. Factors that affect time needed to change the temmperature of matter by a steady amount:

    6a. Nature of the matter (the ability to transfer and retain heat)
   
    6b. Size of sample
   
    6c. Environment surrounding the matter
7. **Conductors** are smooth, dense matter that readily transfer thermal energy. (Ex. Bonners, cookware, irons)
8. **Insulators** are materials that don't transfer thermal energy readily. (Ex. Wood, rubber)
9. Air pockets decrease the density of the substance and prevents energy transfer.
10. **Specific heat** is the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of 1g of matter by 1 degree Celsuis.
11. The ocean has more thermal energy than a glass of water because because the ocean iis mmore massive.
12. Metal spoons transfer most energy from hot water to cold water, and bigger metal spoons transfer more.

### Concept Attainment Quiz

###
1. All of the matter in the same location: **Environment**
2. Anything that has volume and mass: **Matter**
3. Amount of matter in an object, which affects energy transfer: **Mass**
4. Ability to cause change in a system: **Energy**
5. A measurement of average kinetic energy within a substance: **Temperature**
6. The motion of atoms has a direct relationship with their **thermal** energy.
7. The temperature of the surrounding **environment** can affect the transfer of energy.
8. Energy transfer occurs when two objects are at a different **temperature**.
9. The type of **matter** affects the rate of temperature change when thermal energy is transferred.
10. Give an example of how the environment can affect energy transfer:
    
    **If the environment is at the same temperature as the object, then no energy will be transferred. At extremely low temperatures, certain material becomes a superconductor, meaning that no energy is lost to resistance and all of the energy is transferred.**
11. Do all substances transfer the same amount of thermal energy during a cerain amount of time? Why or why not?

    **No, every substance has a unique specific heat, which tells you how quickly an object will heat up or cool off.**
