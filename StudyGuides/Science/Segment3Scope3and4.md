# Segment 3, Scope 3 and 4 Study Guide

## Scope 3 - Electric and Magnetic Forces

1. A hotel's plastic key card opens a door by having various magnetic combinations inside, and magnets in the door has the exact same combination.
    
2. Not all metals are magnetic.

3. When a wire is wrapped around a nail and an electric current is put through the wire, the nail and wire becomes magnetic.

4. **John Travoltage** - 
    When John's foot scraps the ground, his body builds up **electrons**. Then, when he tries to touch the doorknob (**neutral charge**), there is a shock because electrons are being rapidly transferred from John's body (which has way too many electrons) to the doorknob.

5. Two neutrally charged objects have no effect on each other

6. Two like-charged objects repel each other.

7. Two oppositely charged objects attract each other.

8. Distance and magnitude of electric forces between objects have **inverse relationship** (the farther away, the less the magnitude).

9. When electrons transfer from wool cloth to a balloon, the balloon gains **electrons**, making the balloon **negatively charged**.

10. **Static electricity**: A storage of usually negative electric charge on an object caused by the transfer of electrons.

11. **Coulomb's law**: Electric force is directly proportional to an object's charge magnitude (Q).

    If there are charge magnitude for different objects Q1 and Q2:

    - If Q1 is doubled, the electric force doubles.

    - If Q1 is halved, the electric force halves.

    If distance between objects doubles, the electric forces between them divides by four. Distance and electric force have a **nonlinear** relationship.

12. Electromagnetic forces are created by sending an electric current through wires.

13. The more coils of wire, the greater the magnetic field

14. The **electromotive force** keeps electrons orbiting in an atom.

15. **Electricity has to flow** in order for electromagnetics to work.

16. A changing magnetic field creates an electric field.

17. Static electricity acts across distances, forming electric fields (not magnetic fields).

18. When a non-magnetic metal is put within the field of a magnet, it becomes magnetic.

## Scope 4 - Gravitational Forces

19. **Gravity** exists between all objects with mass.

20. The larger the mass, the larger the gravitational force of an object.
