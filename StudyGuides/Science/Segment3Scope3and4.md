# Segment 3, Scope 3 and 4 Study Guide

## Scope 3 - Electric and Magnetic Forces

1. A hotel's plastic key card opens a door by having various magnetic combinations inside, and magnets in the door has the exact same combination.
    
2. Not all metals are magnetic.

3. When a wire is wrapped around a nail and an electric current is put through the wire, the nail and wire becomes magnetic.

4. **John Travoltage** - 
    When John's foot scraps the ground, his body builds up **electrons**. Then, when he tries to touch the doorknob (**neutral charge**), there is a shock because electrons are being rapidly transferred from John's body (which has way too many electrons) to the doorknob.

5. Two neutrally charged objects have no effect on each other

6. Two like-charged objects repel each other.

7. Two oppositely charged objects attract each other.

8. Distance and magnitude of electric forces between objects have **inverse relationship** (the farther away, the less the magnitude).

9. When electrons transfer from wool cloth to a balloon, the balloon gains **electrons**, making the balloon **negatively charged**.

10. **Static electricity**: A storage of usually negative electric charge on an object caused by the transfer of electrons.

11. **Coulomb's law**: Electric force is directly proportional to an object's charge magnitude
