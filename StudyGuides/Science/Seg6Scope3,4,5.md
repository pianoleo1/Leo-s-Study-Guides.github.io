# Segment 6, Scope 3, 4, and 5 Study Guide

## Scope 3

### Packet

1. Refraction underwater causes you to see blurry underwater.

2. Light travels in a straight line and can be blocked by objects.

3. When a beam of light hits water, it undergoes **refraction**.

4. Clear Glass is **transparent**.

5. Wood is **opaque**.

6. 
Mechanical Wave | Electromagnetic Wave
--- | ---
Physical energy that needs a medium to travel through | Energy that do not need a medium to travel through
Ex. Sound | Ex. Light
Ex. Ocean | Ex. Heat

7. The denser the medium, the greater the ray refracts [the closer it is to the normal line (vertical line)]

8. 
Color | Frequency | Wavelength | Energy
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Red** | low | long | low
**Violet** | high | short | high

9. Wavelength and frequency have an **inverse relationship**.

**Visible light**: The range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect.

**Spectrum**: The band of colors produced when light is seperated into its component wavelengths.

**Transmit**: To pass through a medium.

**Refract**: to bend or change direction of a wave.

**Reflect**: To bounce back.

Visible light is only a small portion of the entire electromagnetic scale.

In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at 300,000,000m/s.

Different wavelengths of visible light ranges from 400-700nm.

**Dispertion** is the seperation of white color to various colors.

When electromagnetic waves encounter different media, they go through **reflection, scattering, refraction, dispersion, absorbtion, diffraction, and transmittion**.

Shiny surfaces **reflect** back virtual images, dull surfaces **scatter** light, white **reflects** all light, black **absorbs** all light, red **reflects** only red light.

**Absorption** occurs when all or some of the light energy from light waves are transferred from one medium to another.

In **reflection**, a wave's direction changes, but speed doesn't change.

In **transparent** objects, all light can pass through. In **translucent** objects, some light can pass through. In **opaque** objects, light can't pass through at all.

A change of speed causes the wave to bend when it hits a boundary.

**Refraction** happens when particles in front slows down and the others are still traveling at the same speed.

**Refraction** has many uses, including concave and convex lenses.

**Diffraction** is when waves hit a narrow slit and spreads out.
