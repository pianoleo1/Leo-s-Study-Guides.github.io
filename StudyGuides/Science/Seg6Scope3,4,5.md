17. **Visible light**: The range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect.

18. **Spectrum**: The band of colors produced when light is seperated into its component wavelengths.

19. **Transmit**: To pass through a medium.

20. **Refract**: to bend or change direction of a wave.

21. **Reflect**: To bounce back.

22. Visible light is only a small portion of the entire electromagnetic scale.

23. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at 300,000,000m/s.

24. Different wavelengths of visible light ranges from 400-700nm.

25. **Dispertion** is the seperation of white color to various colors.

26. When electromagnetic waves encounter different media, they go through **reflection, scattering, refraction, dispersion, absorbtion, diffraction, and transmittion**.

27. Shiny surfaces **reflect** back virtual images, dull surfaces **scatter** light, white **reflects** all light, black **absorbs** all light, red **reflects** only red light.

28. **Absorption** occurs when all or some of the light energy from light waves are transferred from one medium to another.

29. In **reflection**, a wave's direction changes, but speed doesn't change.

30. In **transparent** objects, all light can pass through. In **translucent** objects, some light can pass through. In **opaque** objects, light can't pass through at all.

31. A change of speed causes the wave to bend when it hits a boundary.

32. **Refraction** happens when particles in front slows down and the others are still traveling at the same speed.

33. **Refraction** has many uses, including concave and convex lenses.

34. **Diffraction** is when waves hit a narrow slit and spreads out.

### Reading Science A

35. The ray of light traveling towards the mirrorr is called the **incident** ray.

36. **Convex** mirrors show squashed, right side up, and smaller images. 

37. A **concave** mirror, on the other hand, will make objects tall and thin and can be right-side up or upside down.

38. Side-view mirrors in cars are convex because they always show the image right side up.

39. The rearview mirror in cars are flat because it is used to judge actual distance of traffic behind you.

40. **A still lake** would make a good mirror.

### Concept Attainment Quiz

41. **Visible light waves** is the portion of the electromagetic spectrum that humans can see.

42. Energy waves are **reflected** when bounced off an object.

43. The **electromagnetic spectrum** is all the possible energy levels of electromagnetic radiation.

44. When an energy wave is soaked or taken in, it is **absorbed**.

45. **Transmission** is light passing through an object.

46. The color of an object that humans see is actually the **visible spectrum** of light reflected off the object.

47. Light of different wavelengths looks like different **colors** to humans.

48. The electromagnetic spectrum contains a **wide range** of light waves. Some of the waves are visible to humans and some of them cannot be seen by humans.

49. When a rainbow appears in the sky, it is because light from the **visible spectrum** passed through water vapor and **slowed** down, causing the colors in the visible spectrum to break apart.

50. Light travels in a straight line except at surfaces between different transparent materials (e.g., air and water, air and glass) where the light path bends.

51. The electromagnetic spectrum is all of the electromagnetic wavelengths, including radio waves, x-rays, ultraviolet, infrared, and the visible spectrum. The human eye can only pick up a certain set of wavelengths of light; this is what is known as the visible spectrum. Different wavelengths within the visible spectrum are the different colors we see. The visible spectrum is only a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum.

87. **Absorption** is the ability to take in light and different waves of energy.

89. The **electromagnetic spectrum** is a grouping of all possible energy levels of electromagnetic radiation.

90. **Refraction or scattering** is when an energy wave bends as it passes from object to object.

91. **Transmission** is light passing through an object.

92. A **wave** model of light is useful for explaining brightness.

93. Because light can travel through space, it cannot be a **matter** wave.

94. When light passes through a **medium** like water, it will bend.

95. Black cars **absorb** more light waves than white cars, which causes them to heat up more than white cars.

96. A wave model of light is useful for explaining **brightness, color, and the frequency-dependent bending of light at a surface between media**.

97. As the light passes through the different material (the plastic water bottle and the water in the bottle), the speed of the light carrying the letters to your brain varies, causing the light rays to **refract** (bend at larger angles), effectively making the water bottle an **optical lens** (magnifying glass).
