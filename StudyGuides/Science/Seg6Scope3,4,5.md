# Segment 6, Scope 3, 4, and 5 Study Guide

## Scope 3

### Packet

1. Refraction underwater causes you to see blurry underwater.

2. Light travels in a straight line and can be blocked by objects.

3. When a beam of light hits water, it undergoes **refraction**.

4. Clear Glass is **transparent**.

5. Wood is **opaque**.

6. 
Mechanical Wave | Electromagnetic Wave
--- | ---
Physical energy that needs a medium to travel through | Energy that do not need a medium to travel through
Ex. Sound | Ex. Light
Ex. Ocean | Ex. Heat

7. The denser the medium, the greater the ray refracts [the closer it is to the normal line (vertical line)]

8. 
Color | Frequency | Wavelength | Energy
--- | --- | --- | ---
**Red** | low | long | low
**Violet** | high | short | high

9. Wavelength and frequency have an **inverse relationship**.

10. Light reflects differently with each material.

11. If we can see an object, there is light reflecting off it.

12. A prism **disperses** white light.

13.

Violet | Red
--- | ---
Hotter, shorter wavelength | colder, longer wavelength.



14. The higher the temperature, the shorter the wavelength.

15. Blue, Indigo, violet stars have a **shorter wavelength** and are **hotter** than the sun.

16. Orange and red stars have a **longer wavelength** and are colder than the sun.

17. **Visible light**: The range of wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can detect.

18. **Spectrum**: The band of colors produced when light is seperated into its component wavelengths.

19. **Transmit**: To pass through a medium.

20. **Refract**: to bend or change direction of a wave.

21. **Reflect**: To bounce back.

22. Visible light is only a small portion of the entire electromagnetic scale.

23. In a vacuum, all electromagnetic waves travel at 300,000,000m/s.

24. Different wavelengths of visible light ranges from 400-700nm.

25. **Dispertion** is the seperation of white color to various colors.

26. When electromagnetic waves encounter different media, they go through **reflection, scattering, refraction, dispersion, absorbtion, diffraction, and transmittion**.

27. Shiny surfaces **reflect** back virtual images, dull surfaces **scatter** light, white **reflects** all light, black **absorbs** all light, red **reflects** only red light.

28. **Absorption** occurs when all or some of the light energy from light waves are transferred from one medium to another.

29. In **reflection**, a wave's direction changes, but speed doesn't change.

30. In **transparent** objects, all light can pass through. In **translucent** objects, some light can pass through. In **opaque** objects, light can't pass through at all.

31. A change of speed causes the wave to bend when it hits a boundary.

32. **Refraction** happens when particles in front slows down and the others are still traveling at the same speed.

33. **Refraction** has many uses, including concave and convex lenses.

34. **Diffraction** is when waves hit a narrow slit and spreads out.

### Reading Science A

35. The ray of light traveling towards the mirrorr is called the **incident** ray.

36. **Convex** mirrors show squashed, right side up, and smaller images. 

37. A **concave** mirror, on the other hand, will make objects tall and thin and can be right-side up or upside down.

38. Side-view mirrors in cars are convex because they always show the image right side up.

39. The rearview mirror in cars are flat because it is used to judge actual distance of traffic behind you.

40. **A still lake** would make a good mirror.
