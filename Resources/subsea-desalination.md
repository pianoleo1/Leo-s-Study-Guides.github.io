# Briefing - Subsea Desalination Brings Hope from the Deep

## Introduction
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Imagine driving around the ocean on a holiday trip and finding yourself gasping at a peculier, grotesque structure on the surface of the sea. It turns out that those pumps are pumping water from around 1,300 to 2,000 feet (396.24 to 609.6 meters) below sea level.<sup><a href="#works-cited">1</a></sup> Those water connects to the city's waterworks, supplying water, a necessity of life, to faucets, toilets, sprinkling systems, swimming pools, and other water-needers.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It is not needed to sue your water company because this grotesque structure is pumping properly desalinated water from deep in the ocean. Since the 1960s, reverse osmosis allowed saltwater to be filtered so that it is devoid of salt, but it has not gone mainstream until recently.<sup><a href="#works-cited">2</a></sup> While this method is exciting, background information is needed to properly understand the technical details behind this incredible breakthrough.

## Reverse Osmosis

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Osmosis is the diffusion of water molecules across a semi-permeable membrane (or, in biology, a cell membrane).

<br>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; As shown in Fig. 1, water molecules are moving through the membrane to the right because there is a greater concentration of particles in tap water than in pure water, and the solutions naturally want to achieve equilibrium (same concentration of particles). This process does not need any energy because the flow of water molecules is with the concentration gradient. Since the salt ions are charged, the membrane repells them, allowing for filtration of salt from saltwater.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Reverse osmosis (See Fig. 2) uses pressure to force the water molecule flow to go the other way&mdash;from tap water (higher concentration of particles) to pure water (lower concentration of particles). This process requires, for "every 100 gallons of water produced . . . [,] about 1.5 kilowatt-hours of electricity", which is why this was kept from being a popular method in most of the world.<sup><a href="#works-cited">1; 2</a></sup>

## Subsea Desalination

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Recently, though, several companies have come up with a solution to this problem. If reverse osmosis desalination pods are submerged deep in the ocean, they can leverage hydrostatic pressure. This method is called deep sea reverse osmosis (DSRO), and it reduces energy usage by "40 to 50 percent", and furthermore, "modular systems . . . can be deployed to many deep-sea locations without bespoke engineering", making costs more affordable.<sup><a href="#works-cited">2</a></sup>

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Though this method reduces costs significantly, DSRO still has power, water, and signal transmission lines to deal with. OceanWell plans to connect many pods to a central hub, serving as a relay for the pods.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After filtering the seawater, brine is released as a byproduct, which is saltier than seawater. The brine might cause harm to marine ecosystems. For this reason, OceanWell and Floceen, two of many DSRO startups, is developing systems that can "reverse the flow of the pumps periodically to flush microorganisms out of the filters and membranes".<sup><a href="#works-cited">1</a></sup> This strategy will possibly cause less harm to ocean ecosystems.

&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; OceanWell and Floceen are going to deploy around one to ten pods for every site they plan to build at.<sup><a href="#works-cited">1</a></sup> Flocean is already working on a plant near Norway, and the company is trying to supply water starting from 2026.<sup><a href="#works-cited">2</a></sup> Meanwhile, OceanWell's target is California.
